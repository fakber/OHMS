## Reporting Issues
===================
Please use github issues https://github.com/vmware/OHMS/issues to raise new feature requests or bugs.


### How to Contribute
=====================
NOTE: If you do decide to implement code changes and contribute them, please make sure you agree your contribution can be made available under the Apache version 2 license.  If you update an existing files, don’t add another copy of the Apache license hearer and don’t change existing copyright lines from other copyright holders. You may add additional copyright lines.

OHMS uses github’s pull-request process, documented here:
   https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

The pull-request approach allows for individual repositories to adjust things to fit the nature of the project.  Here’s the policies adopted by OHMS to help track reporting and completion of code requests:
* Do not submit pull requests against the master branch. Use the development branch for most pull-requests
* The motivation for new code should be explained in a bug or enhancement request (a github issue with a label that indicates bug or enhancement). Writing a bug or enhancement issue does not commit you to implementing the related code, but we welcome your contributions to address the issues.
* If bug or enhancement request is sufficiently complex, the work should be broken into multiple tasks (github issues with a task label) that explain the scope of work
* If you are planning to write code, please assign related issues to yourself
* Pull requests should refer the issues (bugs, enhancement, tasks) that explain the motivation and scope of work.
